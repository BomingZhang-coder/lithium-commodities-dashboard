# GitHub Folder/File Naming Convention

- Please write your project, then your name
- Separate projects, even if done by the same person, should be in separate folders
- Please use all lowercase
- Use a dash to separate the project name and your name, and underscores everywhere else - do not use spaces
- Try to keep it short and descriptive
- Try not to use special characters, i.e., !@#$%^&*

Examples: 
- "lithium_modeling-birdy"
- "critical_minerals_dashboard-leo_wang"
- "advanced_trading_model-john_harry_wick"
