# Lithium Projects

## Projects

We are collaborating with Professor Geert and Dr Hamid on two separate projects: 

Professor Geert is attempting to forecast the price of lithium via 3 different methods: 
1. Use historical price and various machine learning models
2. Use lithium mining company stock returns to optimise a portfolio that can best predict lithium prices
3. Analyse news data (such as the tone) relating to lithium to create a predictor

Dr Hamid wants to create a critical minerals index to track the price of the raw materials required to create a standard EV lithium-ion battery by factoring in market share of various lithium-ion batteries, spot prices of required minerals, and how much of each mineral is required to make the various batteries. As of July 10, 2024, this index has been created and is under review.

### Last updated July 10, 2024

[Task 1:](_task_1-geert) Xiaolong's work on AR models is priceless. David is continuing his work with other models, such as ARMA, as requested by the professor. 

[Task 2:](_task_2-geert) Birdy's work is still the most recent. We need to understand and either utilise it or use it as inspiration to re-create it. 

[Task 3:](_task_3-geert) This is just a sample, produced by Eli (Yile). Once we have data from the data science team, we can do more comprehensive analysis.

[Critical Mineral Index:](_critical_minerals_index-hamid) Includes the code and the dashboard for the critical minerals index. Dashboard is not using the data from the index yet.

### Team members and progress

1. David: Digested [Xiaolong's previous work](lithium_price_forecasting-xiaolong) and completed [in-sample ARMA models](lithium_price_forecasting_task_1-david), going to email professor results shortly. 

2. Lily, Leo, Eli, Rashibh: Completing report on Birdy's past progress located in this [folder](task_2-birdy) that has made plenty of progress identyfing the list of companies we are working with, getting their stock data, standardizing currency, etc. Digesting this [folder](lithium_modeling-birdy) which seems to model the price of lithium via the work Birdy did on the mining companies. 

3. Eli: Requesting queries, finding relevant columns, to share with the data science team to query lithium news data. [Sample analysis on news](lithium_news_analysis-yile/Sample.ipynb)

## Dr Hamid's critical minerals index project:

David: Completed [critical minerals index](critical_minerals_index-david), awaiting Dr Hamid's feedback. 

Leo: Created a [dashboard](critical_minerals_index_dashboard-leo/LeoWang-Critical_Minerals_Dashboard) using dummy data, awaiting data from David after Dr Hamid's feedback
