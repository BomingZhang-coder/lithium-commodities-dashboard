# Lithium Projects

We are collaborating with Professor Geert and Dr Hamid on two separate projects. 

Professor Geert is attempting to forecast the price of lithium via 3 different methods: 
1. Use historical price and various machine learning models
2. Use lithium mining company stock returns to optimise a portfolio that can best predict lithium prices
3. Analyse news data (such as the tone) relating to lithium to create a predictor

Dr Hamid wants to create a critical minerals index to track the price of the raw materials required to create a standard EV lithium-ion battery by factoring in market share of various lithium-ion batteries, spot prices of required minerals, and how much of each mineral is required to make the various batteries. As of July 10, 2024, this index has been created and is under review.
